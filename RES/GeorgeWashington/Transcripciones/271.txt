Letters Orders and Instructions. October 1755. - 271.
28th. To Ensign Fleming of the Virginia Regiment.
You are hereby ordered to repair to
Captain Hogg's Company at Fort Dinwiddie
with eight good mens: as that Company is
without a Surgeon if you will do that duty an
allowance will be made you for it. You are
to provide medicines etc. upon the best terms
you can. This Order I expect will be immedi -
ately complied with; and that no Delays be of -
fered. You are to account with Captain Bell
for your recruiting money before you leave him.
If you should arrive at Augusta Court House
before Sergeant Wilper and his Party you are to
halt there until he joins in order to escort the
Ammunition etc. for the Fort; where you will
receive Clothes and Arms for the Men.
28th. To Captain Bell of the Virginia Regiment.
I have Ordered Ensign Fleming
to Repair to Captain Hoggs Company with eight
good men; which I expect you will see immedi -
ately complied with. He is to account with you
for his recruiting money before he leaves you.
You are hereby ordered peremptorily to be at
this place with what men you have or can en -
list by the 1st. of December. Your late disobedi -
ence of Orders has greatly displeased me. It is
impofsible to carry on affairs as they ought to be
when you pay so little regard to the Force of a
Military Order - You must be conscious within
yourself (or at least ought to be) that your Crime
is sufficient to Break the best Officer that ever
bore a Commifsion.
