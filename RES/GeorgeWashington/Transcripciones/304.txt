be kind enough to intimate this to General
Shirley or the Colonels of those Regiments - it
would be of service to uss: without leave we

Alexandrias: December
5th. 1755.
5th. To John Robinson Esquire Speaker.
The Bearer captain John Mercer
having leave to go down and Settle his ac -
compts with the Committee; is ordered to
call upon you for the balance of the ten
thousand pounds which I believe we shall
want before another opportunity may offer;
this being the time when our Demands for
money are greatest. When I left Willi -
amsburgh I intended to proceed to Winches -
ter; but meeting with Letters at Fredericks -
burgh informing me that peace prevailed
above and that nothing was immediate -
ly wanted but Salt; I came up here to en -
gage what I could and to wait the arrival
of some Recruits at this place; and a Vefsel
with sundry arms etc. for the Troops. This Vef -
sel left Williamsburgh two days after I did
and is not yet arriveds: neither is the Ex -
prefs returned which the Governor sent to
General Shirley for Commifsions for the
Field Officers of our Regiments: which gives
me much concern; fearing that this de -
lay is ominous. In that case I shall not
know how to act; - it will be uselefs for me
